Once upon a time, there was a man who lived on the edge of the world. He wore a yellow rain jacket and a matching yellow hat because it always rains at the edge of the world. Every day the man looked over the edge and wondered what was beyond. The edge of the world was a lonely place, but the man had a kitty cat that kept him company. A mailman also visited him with news about town and packages of dehydrated food. Occasionally the mailman even brought him actual mail. Today the mailman came with his deliveries, and all he found was a note and the man’s yellow hat. The note said, “Gone to see what’s out there. Feed the cat.”

He traveled for 10 long days, walking by night to avoid the heat of the desert, and resting in the shade by day. After 10 days he saw an oasis on the horizon. But as he got closer, he became nervous, for he could see people moving around the oasis. He hadn't been near any amount of people in many a long year. And so it went, the closer he got, the slower he walked, not wanting to stay in the desert, but also not wanting to talk to other people. But before he made up his mind, they saw him.
