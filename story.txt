Once upon a time, there was a man who lived on the edge of the world. He wore a yellow rain jacket and a matching yellow hat because it always rains at the edge of the world. Every day the man looked over the edge and wondered what was beyond. The edge of the world was a lonely place, but the man had a kitty cat that kept him company. A mailman also visited him with news about town and packages of dehydrated food. Occasionally the mailman even brought him actual mail. Today the mailman came with his deliveries, and all he found was a note and the man’s yellow hat. The note said, “Gone to see what’s out there. Feed the cat.”
